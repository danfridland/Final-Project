# Final-Project
My final project is a demonstration disperse payload that connects to a drone, and can fire any type of 40 mm ammuniton.
The main feature of the payload is the puncture system that was developed from zero by me.
Although the project was made by 2 people, I can say with absoult confidence that the desgin of the hole project was made solely by me.
